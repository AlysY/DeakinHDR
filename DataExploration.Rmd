```{r data}
head(iris)

# Summary
summary(iris)

```{r stats}
mean(iris$Sepal.Length)
mean(iris$Sepal.Width)

# sd
sd(iris$Sepal.Length)
sd(iris$Sepal.Width)
```

Based on this, I will do ~ and ~


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r plot}
plot(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Sepal.Width )
```
